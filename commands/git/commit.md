# /git:commit

<instructions>
Generate commit message from staged changes
</instructions>

<approach>
1. Analyze staged changes for what was actually modified
2. Describe only the content changes, not improvements or claims
3. Use conventional commit format (type: description)
4. Execute the commit with the generated message
NEVER include "Generated with Claude Code" or "Co-Authored-By: Claude" - no AI attribution whatsoever.
Write concisely and professionally.
</approach>
