# /build-context

<instructions>
Build deep understanding of the specified target to establish comprehensive mental model
</instructions>

<approach>
Phase 1 - Survey: Map architecture, dependencies, and boundaries of target
Phase 2 - Analyze: Identify core patterns, abstractions, and data flows
Phase 3 - Internalize: Build working mental model of design decisions
Priority: Core domains and critical paths over peripheral code
Output: Enhanced understanding only - no files created
</approach>
